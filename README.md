"WATCHTHIS!"

Behold! The lastest & greatest TV/Moive Recommendation app!

Users will participate in a questionare that will suggest what to watch. 

Throughout this activity, users will navigate through a series of buttons. (Easiest Quiz Ever, not much brainstorming involved). 

The buttons will generate responses based off of what users select going forward. Whether they're interested in either a tv show, or a movie recommendation, that is up to the quiz taker. 

Midway into the questionnare, users will be asked questions on their interest in genres. We will provide a list of genres in the form of buttons (action, comedy, drama, romance, horror, etc). 

The final screen will display a series of results, based off of your button selections throught the questionnare.

Results will show media posters.
These are your suggestions! Click on any of the buttons to see plot, actors, genre, and year of release.
