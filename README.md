# Group_Project_1

"Watch This App!" 

Users will participate in a questionare that will suggest what to watch. 

Throughout this media query, users will navigate through a series of buttons. (Easiest Quiz Ever, not much brainstorming involved). 

The buttons will generate responses based off of what users select going forward. Whether they're interested in either a tv show, or a movie recommendation, that is up to the quiz taker. 

Midway into the questionnare, users will be asked questions on their interest in genres. We will provide a list of genres in the form of buttons (action, comedy, drama, romance, horror, etc). 

The final screen will illustrate series of results. Results will show genres interest, tv show and movie suggestions.
