##WatchThis!

"What Should I Watch?" (Title)

Users will participate in a questionare.

Questions will ask the user if they're interested in either a tv show, or movie.

Ask questions on interest in genres (Putting Genres into buttons?). We will provide a list of genres (action, comedy, drama, romance, horror).

Maybe, make it specific to an actor, or decade (80's romance, 90's comedy).

Final screen will illustrate series of results. Results will show genres interest, tv show and movie suggestions.
