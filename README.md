Car Website (Like an Online Garage). That can utilize and store information that will help users keep up-to-date with their vehicles.

Features will show the next time you may need an oil change, an alignment, engine check, rotating tires, etc. (This will be more like a notice feature). Maybe You will be able to have a service that can supplement car parts.

We want to have an option where you can remove and add a vehicle on our site. Reason being, so that you can be able to keep up with your garage.

API Suggestions: Edmunds API, Vin Audit ID, Google Maps.(While Using Firebase, to store user vehicle data).

Google maps could be used to provide a list of nearby shops for service or parts.
